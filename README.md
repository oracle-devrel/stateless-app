## Introduction
This is the eclipse project for some simple stateless apps

## Getting Started
There are three Eclipse projects in this repo

StatelessYaml - contains the YAML files and also example configs to use for deployments. Please look at the [README.md](./StatelessYaml/README.md) file in that project for instructions on how to install and run these stateless applications in Kubrnetes

StatelessFront - a **very** simple application based on the front ent part of the Helidon example "Greeting" application (`/greet`). This only does the front end processing, it communiucates to the StatelessBack application to get the prefix used byt the greeting. 

StatelessBack - a **very** simple application based on the back end (Greeting provider code) of the Helidon example "Greeting" application (`/prefix`). This only supports the retrieval and setting of the prefix. 

Using two separate microservices is of course a completely artificial split but is intended to enable the exploration of in Kubernetes communications.

Both of the "Front" and "Back" applications also provide `/openapi`, `/metrics`, and `/health` endpoints. They also provide mechanisms to simulate fault conditions.

### Prerequisites
You will need Maven (3.8.5 works, earlier may not) and Java 17
